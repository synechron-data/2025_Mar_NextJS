Create a React component that functions as a counter with increment and decrement capabilities. 
The component should manage its state according to specific rules and handle user interactions as outlined below.

Requirements
1. Initial State:
    The component should have three buttons: +, -, and Reset.
        a. When the component loads, the + and - buttons should be enabled.
        b. The Reset button should be disabled.
        c. The counter should start at 0.
        d. The counter should have an interval of 1 by default, unless an interval prop is provided.

2. Button Functionality:
    a. Clicking the + button should increase the counter by the specified interval.
    b. Clicking the - button should decrease the counter by the specified interval.

3. Click Limit:
    a. After a total of 10 clicks on either the + or - buttons, both buttons should be disabled.
    b. The Reset button should then be enabled.

4. Reset Functionality:
    Clicking the Reset button should reinitialize the component to its initial state:
        a. The count should reset to 0.
        b. The + and - buttons should be enabled.
        c. The Reset button should be disabled.
